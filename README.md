Do you like the idea of changing light timing temperature and humidity settings from anywhere that you have an internet connetion?
If so HOBloom is for you.  This system allows you to purchase some very cost efficient hardware and sensors giving you the features 
of multi thousand dollar systems for anywhere from around $60 for basic monitoring.  You can add smart outlets to control appliacnes and lights 
built your system out piece by piece for very low prices.
